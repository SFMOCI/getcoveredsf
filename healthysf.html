Healthy SF is not insurance. You may qualify for the expanded Medi-Cal program. Go to <a href="http://www.coveredca.com">Covered California</a> to fill out an enrollment form or call 311. â€¨If you don't qualify for Medi-Cal or Covered California subsidy, you could still be eligible for Healthy SF.

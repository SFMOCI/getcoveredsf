Why should you offer coverage to your employees?
<ol>
	<li><b>It's easy</b>. Everything you need is available online, by phone or in person. Covered California will handle premium collection, enrollment and plan payments. Even if your employees choose different plans, you need only make a single payment to Covered California. 
	<li><b>It's affordable</b>. You are eligible for tax credits if you provide health care coverage for your employees, provided that you have fewer than 25 full-time equivalent employees who are paid an average annual salary of less than $50,000.
	<li><b>It will make you more productive</b>.Giving your employees access to health coverage can reduce absenteeism and help prevent small health problems from turning into costly larger ones. 
	<li><b>It will attract the best</b>. Providing health insurance to employees helps you recruit and retain top talent. 
	<li><b>You're on a level playing field</b>. The Covered California health insurance exchange gives you access to an insurance pool of all small businesses in California. Like larger insurance pools, the exchange offers greater purchasing power, lower costs, reduced premiums and more health plan choices.
	<li><b>Your coverage is guaranteed - and fair</b>. Insurers can't turn you down based on the health status of your employees or their dependents, even if they have pre-existing conditions. Insurance plans can't charge you higher premiums for women, or increase your group's premium for employees with high medical costs.

			Here are ten reasons why you should enroll.

<ol>
	<li><b>It's easy</b>. With the Covered California Exchange, you can shop for and compare insurance plans online, on the phone, or in person to work out the coverage levels, prices and quality scores that matter to you.
	<li><b>It's affordable</b>. For many people, health insurance is more affordable than before on the Covered CA Exchange.
	<li><b>You get preventative care</b>. Plans available in the Exchange provide free vaccines, screenings, and check-ups, and also cover some prescription drug costs.
	<li><b>Your health status is not a barrier to getting insurance</b>. You cannot be denied health insurance coverage due to a preexisting condition.
	<li><b>Your out-of-pocket expenses are limited</b>. New maximums cap the amount that you will have to pay out-of-pocket for coverage.
	<li><b>Your coverage is not limited</b>. There are no yearly or lifetime limits on how much health plans in the Exchange will spend to cover essential health benefits.
	<li><b>You're protecting your future</b>. You never know when a medical emergency will strike, and unanticipated medical expenses can be financially devastating. You can protect your health and your family's financial future by getting health insurance. 
	<li><b>You're supporting your community</b>. By getting insurance you are helping the entire community since we all pay the cost of providing care to those without insurance.
	<li><b>You need to get it</b>. Starting in January 2014, most people will be required to have health insurance or pay a penalty if they don't. Coverage can include employer-provided insurance, coverage you buy, Medicare or MediCal.
	<li><b>You may be eligible for financial assistance</b>. Many individuals will receive assistance through Covered CA for monthly premiums, co-pays and programs such as MediCal.
